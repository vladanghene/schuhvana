13. Vlad prefers having payment integration using Stripe for his online store projects and prefers using Stripe test mode price IDs for integration. The current test mode price ID for the Seagate Drive product is 'price_1Q5XITDLrkF9rRuMSD1rXeWL'.
14. Vlad prefers having a view for the '/success' route that displays a random optimistic image from Giphy whenever a user returns from Stripe. Vlad prefers using the Giphy API key '0H1VG2rg5wttq7nLMBtgMbCxpkkbY6ab' for fetching images in the '/success' route.
15. Vlad prefers that the '.env' file containing private keys be excluded from the Git repository when providing project zips. Sensitive information should be kept out of the version history.
16. Vlad prefers both the frontend and backend integrated in the same project structure with a unified Git history. All changes should be committed under a single repository.
17. Vlad prefers the Git archive to always be named 'amazon-inspired-store-git.zip'.
18. Vlad prefers to ensure that both the frontend and backend use HTTPS. For local development, the backend should be served over HTTPS using a self-signed certificate for consistency. Vlad prefers using 'mkcert' to generate SSL certificates for local development to avoid compatibility issues.
19. Vlad prefers succinct updates, with verbose details moved to Git commit messages.
20. Vlad prefers the backend to always run on port '5656' instead of the default port to avoid conflicts with other processes on his machine. The 'server.js' file should be updated to always use port '5656' as requested.
21. Vlad prefers the frontend to run on port '8080'.
22. Vlad prefers using a Vuex store for managing state updates in the frontend. Future implementations should leverage the existing store for data management.
23. Vlad prefers that all future commits have distinct comments describing the changes made.
24. Vlad prefers a complete folder structure including both frontend and backend components in every zip file provided, and the full project size should match the previous versions. Ensure that all future project modifications include a complete folder structure, with both frontend and backend components, and the full project size should match the previous versions.
25. Vlad prefers having a backend where he can edit all the products and modify: title, price, image name (or upload image to be saved in the assets directory), price_id for Stripe checkout, product description, and product category. Vlad prefers using MongoDB for persisting product information in the backend. The backend structure should conform to the overall existing design, with corresponding views and links added in the top menu. Ensure that all admin components, such as the Admin Products View, Edit Product Feature, Create New Product, and Delete Product options, are included in the project. Additionally, all admin views should be linked in the header menu for easy access. The dynamic category filtering should be synchronized between the admin and frontend views.
26. Vlad prefers reverting the project to the version before switching to the existing store, ensuring the original Vuex store configuration, state management, and structure. Vlad also prefers reverting the project to the version before switching any file paths or commit history modifications that caused structural divergence. Ensure the entire backend and frontend are restored with all dependencies and configurations intact. This stable version should be used as the baseline for future restorations if needed. The project should include all previously implemented components like the Stripe API integration, full checkout flow, and admin editing features. Any missing components should be restored to match the version confirmed as stable earlier.
27. Vlad prefers working with Git bundle files when restoring or transferring repositories for the 'amazon-inspired-store' project.
28. Vlad prefers that clicking the store name in the header returns to the home route, refreshes the view to the homepage, and updates the browser path.
29. Vlad prefers making the title of the website a link to the homepage and including a commit message 'updated header for store title' when modifying this feature.
30. Vlad is starting a fresh project for the current session and prefers that it is tracked with a new memory entry. Keep all updates relevant to the project documented for this session.
31. Vlad's current project repository includes both backend and frontend structures. The project is set up with a Node.js backend using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for product management, and a Vue.js frontend utilizing Vuex, Stripe, and router integration. The repository is integrated with an HTTPS server, uses MongoDB for persisting product data, and includes a dynamic category filtering system. The project is organized under a unified structure with the necessary scripts and a setup bash script for deployment.
32. Vlad prefers creating project files locally during sessions to then archive and send them as a zip file for download.
33. Vlad prefers the individual product components to stand out visually like cards, with hover animations to enhance interactivity and make the products more appealing. Future designs should implement these features in product displays.
34. Vlad prefers colorful and visually appealing designs that are more spaced out compared to simple, minimalistic styles. Vlad prefers creating retro-themed online storefronts using Vue.js, styled to resemble the vibrant aesthetics of the 60s and 70s, with features like a 9x9 grid layout on the homepage, a title in the header called 'Hippie Ville' styled in vibrant colors, and a navigation menu underneath with categories like Sunglasses, Clothes, Help Bags, and All Fashion. The color scheme and theme should be directly inspired by the updated 'Hippie Ville' logo, which has a round shape, floral patterns, and vibrant rainbow elements. Future designs should incorporate the full color scheme from the updated 'Hippie Ville' logo, including the hues visible in the bottom right section of the logo, into the styling of all storefront elements. Key elements include a colorful homepage design, a centered store title, and a vibrant navigation menu inspired by the updated 'Hippie Ville' logo. The code structure should prioritize separate components for UI elements, leveraging Vue.js flexibility for future expansions and functionality integration. Future projects should incorporate this color palette and visual style wherever possible, emphasizing these details in the design. Vlad prefers using Tailwind CSS for styling and prefers incorporating a defined color scheme based on extracted colors. Future designs should use these colors to create visually consistent themes. Components should be refreshed to reflect these style choices, maintaining alignment with the vibrant and neutral colors outlined for a cohesive look.
35. Vlad prefers the final CSS file to always be named 'style.css' for all future updates, regardless of modifications.
36. Vlad prefers receiving all project files together, even if only some are modified. However, for small projects or simpler file structures, Vlad prefers receiving all files together in a single archive.
37. Vlad has added the assistant as a collaborator on the GitHub repository 'storefront'.
38. Vlad prefers a novel structure where the main character succumbs to an unexplained illness in the first half, recovers suddenly, and later discovers she was poisoned by the villain, whom she catches with the help of the local police as he tries to flee the country.
39. Vlad prefers the story to have 10 chapters altogether.
40. Vlad prefers that Hannah uses magnets on her fridge door instead of a corkboard to track clues in the investigation.

42. Vlad prefers that Hannah eats noodle takeout and drinks lots of 0.33 Heineken beers. Hannah has only beer in the fridge, and she sometimes uses the cold bottles to soothe her mosquito bites.
43. Vlad prefers that Hannah does not realize she saw the man previously until later in Chapter 5.
44. Vlad prefers Chapter 1 to be revised with a denser narrative, adding more descriptions and inner thoughts of Hannah as she does mundane things, connecting them to theories about human psychology.

51. Vlad prefers that in Hannah’s small living quarters, there is a big clock on the wall making tick-tock noises that she only hears when she calms herself and her thoughts, usually when
51. Vlad prefers that in Hannah’s small living quarters, there is a big clock on the wall making tick-tock noises that she only hears when she calms herself and her thoughts, usually when she goes to bed. It always drives her mad that she forgets to take it out of commission, and at the same time, she doesn’t understand how she can’t hear it during the daytime.

52. Vlad prefers the first sentence of the book to be: "When the dust settles, the inconsistencies are the ones left screaming at you. Begging for your attention, they only now stand out, and what you've felt was somehow out of place proves now more so." This is what Hannah is thinking as she climbs the stairs, carrying a paper bag containing her only grocery: beer.

53. Vlad prefers the novel to begin in Hannah's apartment as she enters it, being all sweaty and tired.

54. Vlad prefers that Hannah does not surround herself with junk because she rents her apartment and is minimalistic in nature. Her most valuable belongings are in a jewelry box, which contains pictures and jewelry of her passed-away mother.

55. Vlad prefers that Hannah does not have long hair, but also not too short either. She has sidebar hairs.

56. Vlad prefers that in paragraph 5 of Chapter 1, it is mentioned that Hannah’s side hair was wet and clinging to her cheeks, giving her a nice, frenzied look.

57. Vlad prefers merging some paragraphs together in future texts to make them longer for a varied structure.

58. Vlad prefers the word 'haphazardly' to be removed from the sentence: 'Everything looked disorganized, haphazardly thrown together' in Chapter 1.

59. Vlad prefers that the sentence 'Her gut instincts had never failed her before' be changed to 'Her gut instincts have never failed her before' in Chapter 1.

60. Vlad prefers that in Chapter 2, as Hannah wakes up, she hears the annoying buzz of a mosquito.

61. Vlad prefers that Hannah wakes up sweating in the next chapter after the vision.

62. Vlad prefers that the concealed object in the ashes is a keychain with a bottle opener, which the antagonist accidentally dropped while setting the fire. It serves as a pivotal clue in the investigation.

63. Vlad prefers that in the vision, instead of the shadow whispering 'Look beneath the ashes,' the shadow grabs her, then turns into ashes and falls over her, including into her open mouth, which she was trying to scream with but couldn’t.

64. Vlad prefers that the revised version of the paragraph: 

"The heat. The long, grueling nights. Chasing leads that always seemed to fizzle out—it was wearing her down. How long could she keep this up? She leaned back, rubbing her temples. The ache behind her eyes felt permanent now, as if it had taken root. Sleep. She needed real sleep. Not just those snatches of restless dozing. Would it even help at this point? Probably not. She knew better. Why even bother trying?" 

be kept in Chapter 1 in place of the original.

65. Vlad prefers the narrative style to focus more on Hannah's perspective and internal experience rather than describing her actions or surroundings from an external viewpoint. Future revisions should capture her thoughts, senses, and emotions more directly.

66. Vlad prefers the "inner voice style," which captures Hannah’s direct thoughts, sensations, and emotions without external descriptions, to be used specifically in the vision scene of Chapter 1. Future revisions should apply this style only to the vision scenes.

67. Vlad prefers using shorter paragraphs with varied lengths to intensify the vision scenes when applying the inner voice style.

68. Vlad prefers keeping the following version of the vision scene in Chapter 1:

"Everything blurred. Voices, laughter, fragments of sound and scent, all swirling together. Boats bobbing. People waving. Just… noise. It surrounded her, pressed in from every direction—too many sounds at once. Crashing over her like waves. So loud she couldn’t think. So sharp it hurt. The smell of the sea. Strong. Biting. The thick scent of wet wood. The bitter tang of metal. But none of it made sense. Not like this.

It shouldn’t feel so… real. Something shifted.

Her body felt strange. Smaller. Lighter. She blinked. No, she was a child again. Tiny hands, frail arms. The pier seemed to stretch forever. Endless. Faces blurred into one another. She couldn’t see them. Who were they? Why were they waving? Waving at her? Panic prickled down her spine.

The babble of voices grew louder, buzzing in her ears like a swarm of angry bees. Her heart hammered. And then— Silence. Everything stilled. The people…gone. No sound. Nothing. Just the wooden planks stretching out in front of her. Empty. Hollow.

Why was it so quiet?

Her mouth moved. No words. No breath.

A shape shifted at the corner of her vision.

Dark. Wrong. A shadow.

It slithered through where the people had been. Slinking closer. Closer. Her legs started feeling like they were made of lead. Heavy. Too heavy. She tried to run, but everything dragged, everything was slow. The shadow loomed, twisted. Reached for her.

No! No, no, no—run!

But she couldn’t. Her feet were trapped in syrup, in mud, in nothing at all. The shadow’s hand stretched. Dark tendrils curled around her ankle. Cold. Ice cold. Sinking into her bones.

It yanked her back.

She stumbled. Panic exploded through her. She kicked, thrashed, fought. But it was too strong. The shadow wrapped around her. Black. Consuming. Her arms pinned. Her throat tight. Everything dark. It melted. Dissolving into ash.

Hot. Dry. A thousand grains of sand scraping against her skin. The ash swirled, fell over her.

She couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. It filled her mouth, her nose—coating her tongue with the taste of burnt, bitter smoke. Falling. Choking.

Desperation clawed at her.

She wanted to cough, to spit it out. But she couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. It was suffocating her. Burying her alive.

No escape.

No—

Nothing.

Just darkness."

This version should be used for all future references to the vision scene in Chapter 1.

Let me know if you’d like any additional information or if there’s a specific part of the project you’d like to focus on!

	86.	Vlad prefers the ProductCard.vue to have a minimalist design with a hover effect that subtly enlarges the card and increases the image brightness. The card should include the product image, name, price, and a “Quick View” button.
	87.	Vlad prefers a ProductDetail.vue view that displays a larger product image on the left, with product information, size options, a “Add to Cart” button, and a description on the right. The layout should be clean and organized, with a focus on usability.
	88.	Vlad prefers a Cart.vue page that shows a summary of items, with the ability to update quantities or remove items. A total price section and a “Proceed to Checkout” button should be prominent.
	89.	Vlad prefers a Checkout.vue page with a form for entering shipping details, payment information, and an order summary. The page should be easy to navigate, with clear calls to action for submitting the order.
	90.	Vlad prefers the Footer.vue component to include links to About Us, Customer Service, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and social media icons.

	51. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that in Hannah’s small living quarters, there is a big clock on the wall making tick-tock noises that she only hears when she calms herself and her thoughts, usually when she goes to bed. It always drives her mad that she forgets to take it out of commission, and at the same time, she doesn’t understand how she can’t hear it during the daytime.

52. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers the first sentence of the book to be: "When the dust settles, the inconsistencies are the ones left screaming at you. Begging for your attention, they only now stand out, and what you've felt was somehow out of place proves now more so." This is what Hannah is thinking as she climbs the stairs, carrying a paper bag containing her only grocery: beer.

53. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers the novel to begin in Hannah's apartment as she enters it, being all sweaty and tired.

54. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that Hannah does not surround herself with junk because she rents her apartment and is minimalistic in nature. Her most valuable belongings are in a jewelry box, which contains pictures and jewelry of her passed-away mother.

55. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that Hannah does not have long hair, but also not too short either. She has sidebar hairs.

56. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that in paragraph 5 of Chapter 1, it is mentioned that Hannah’s side hair was wet and clinging to her cheeks, giving her a nice, frenzied look.

57. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers merging some paragraphs together in future texts to make them longer for a varied structure.

58. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers the word 'haphazardly' to be removed from the sentence: 'Everything looked disorganized, haphazardly thrown together' in Chapter 1.

59. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that the sentence 'Her gut instincts had never failed her before' be changed to 'Her gut instincts have never failed her before' in Chapter 1.

60. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that in Chapter 2, as Hannah wakes up, she hears the annoying buzz of a mosquito.

61. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that Hannah wakes up sweating in the next chapter after the vision.

62. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that the concealed object in the ashes is a keychain with a bottle opener, which the antagonist accidentally dropped while setting the fire. It serves as a pivotal clue in the investigation.

63. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that in the vision, instead of the shadow whispering 'Look beneath the ashes,' the shadow grabs her, then turns into ashes and falls over her, including into her open mouth, which she was trying to scream with but couldn’t.

64. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers that the revised version of the paragraph: 

"The heat. The long, grueling nights. Chasing leads that always seemed to fizzle out—it was wearing her down. How long could she keep this up? She leaned back, rubbing her temples. The ache behind her eyes felt permanent now, as if it had taken root. Sleep. She needed real sleep. Not just those snatches of restless dozing. Would it even help at this point? Probably not. She knew better. Why even bother trying?" 

be kept in Chapter 1 in place of the original.

65. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers the narrative style to focus more on Hannah's perspective and internal experience rather than describing her actions or surroundings from an external viewpoint. Future revisions should capture her thoughts, senses, and emotions more directly.

66. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers the "inner voice style," which captures Hannah’s direct thoughts, sensations, and emotions without external descriptions, to be used specifically in the vision scene of Chapter 1. Future revisions should apply this style only to the vision scenes.

67. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers using shorter paragraphs with varied lengths to intensify the vision scenes when applying the inner voice style.

68. [2024-10-06]. Vlad prefers keeping the following version of the vision scene in Chapter 1:

"Everything blurred. Voices, laughter, fragments of sound and scent, all swirling together. Boats bobbing. People waving. Just… noise. It surrounded her, pressed in from every direction—too many sounds at once. Crashing over her like waves. So loud she couldn’t think. So sharp it hurt. The smell of the sea. Strong. Biting. The thick scent of wet wood. The bitter tang of metal. But none of it made sense. Not like this.

It shouldn’t feel so… real. Something shifted.

Her body felt strange. Smaller. Lighter. She blinked. No, she was a child again. Tiny hands, frail arms. The pier seemed to stretch forever. Endless. Faces blurred into one another. She couldn’t see them. Who were they? Why were they waving? Waving at her? Panic prickled down her spine.

The babble of voices grew louder, buzzing in her ears like a swarm of angry bees. Her heart hammered. And then— Silence. Everything stilled. The people…gone. No sound. Nothing. Just the wooden planks stretching out in front of her. Empty. Hollow.

Why was it so quiet?

Her mouth moved. No words. No breath.

A shape shifted at the corner of her vision.

Dark. Wrong. A shadow.

It slithered through where the people had been. Slinking closer. Closer. Her legs started feeling like they were made of lead. Heavy. Too heavy. She tried to run, but everything dragged, everything was slow. The shadow loomed, twisted. Reached for her.

No! No, no, no—run!

But she couldn’t. Her feet were trapped in syrup, in mud, in nothing at all. The shadow’s hand stretched. Dark tendrils curled around her ankle. Cold. Ice cold. Sinking into her bones.

It yanked her back.

She stumbled. Panic exploded through her. She kicked, thrashed, fought. But it was too strong. The shadow wrapped around her. Black. Consuming. Her arms pinned. Her throat tight. Everything dark. It melted. Dissolving into ash.

Hot. Dry. A thousand grains of sand scraping against her skin. The ash swirled, fell over her.

She couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. It filled her mouth, her nose—coating her tongue with the taste of burnt, bitter smoke. Falling. Choking.

Desperation clawed at her.

She wanted to cough, to spit it out. But she couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. It was suffocating her. Burying her alive.

No escape.

No—

Nothing.

Just darkness."

This version should be used for all future references to the vision scene in Chapter 1.
